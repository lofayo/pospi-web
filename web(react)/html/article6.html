            This is already the expectation of consumers today, when mobile device usage within the store is still in its relative infancy. This appetite for innovation on behalf of the consumer is only going to increase – which highlights a huge opportunity for retailers.
            <br>
            <br> Some  prefer to wait and watch for further developments. Others are already using mobile devices to transform store operations and drive the ability to connect and serve customers like never before.
            <br>
            <br> “Innisfree, as one of the fastest growing brands under Amorepacific, has inherited the spirit of innovation and achieved a geometric growth over the past 4 years, especially in the Chinese market. The application of Mobile POS allows them to offer a personalized service to the customers at retail stores. Each of salespersons is now equipped with a mobile POS which has successfully eliminated queuing and empowered them to respond to customer’s various requests anywhere, anytime on the floor.”
