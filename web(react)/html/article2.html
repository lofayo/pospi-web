            <br> The relationship between retailers and consumers has considerably evolved. Consumers are looking for the best product, at the best price, with the highest level of service and through an innovative consumer experience. Consumers want to be involved in the purchase process. POSPi X-SHOP is the key to tomorrow’s retail success: liberty to purchase whenever or wherever the consumer chooses (in-store or out of-store) and from any device, liberty to compare prices, liberty to use social platform for shopping, liberty to choose the best store, liberty to pay wherever they are in the store etc...
